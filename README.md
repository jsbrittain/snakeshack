# snakeshack

** This is a work-in-progress repository of Snakemake workflows as basis for
a version controlled system of modular pipeline construction.**

The `workflows` folder contains labs or workflows that are contributing
Snakemake modules. Each modules should be a Snakemake workflow that
is self-contained and fully compliant with redistribution best-practices as
outlined on the Snakemake
[Distribution and Reproducibility](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html)
pages, specifically the
[Uploading workflows to WorkflowHub](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html#uploading-workflows-to-workflowhub)
folder structure.

Additional rules to ensure modular compatibility and re-use with this repository
are expected to be posted as they evolve.
